# _Macroeconomics and Inequality_

 This website hosts some of the material for the MSc-level course _Macroeconomics and Inequality_ at the At the University of Vienna. The corresponding Github repository is [here](https://github.com/greimel/macro-inequality).

The course is in its first edition in Spring 2025. It builds on a PhD-level course I have given at the Tinbergen Institute Amsterdam 2022â€“2024.
