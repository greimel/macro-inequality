# Solving Heterogeneous Agents models using Sequence Space Jacobians - from scratch!

## by Matthias Hänsel

This notebook demonstrates how to solve a neoclassical Heterogenous Agents business cycle model using the Sequence Space Jacobian (SSJ) linearization method proposed by  *[Auclert et al. (2021 - henceforth ABRS)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA17434)*

ABRS themselves have written a comprehensive *[Python package](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian)* implementing their method. In many cases, you may simply want to use that.

However, in case you do not want to, e.g. because you prefer to use a different language or use model extensions not easily accommodated by their package, you'll have to program up things yourself. Here, I show you how that can be done for the simple Krusell and Smith (1998)-type model also used in the ABRS paper.

This notebook focusses on practical implementation in **Julia**, for the theory behind you should read the paper. The hope is that understanding how to implement the method for a simple setting will also help you understanding how you can use it for different, more complicated environments.

The notebook assumes some familiarity with Julia and features the following parts:

1. Description of the model
2. Solving/Calibrating the steady state 
3. Implementing the SSJ method

* I tried to focus more on a *clear* and *simple* implementation instead one optimized for speed.


* You'll see that once you can implement the model's steady state, getting linearized IRFs using SSJ is fairly easy.


* In Julia, you can easily get the Jacobians of the Heterogenous Block using *automatic differentiation* with the `ForwardDiff.jl` package. This can potentially give you more exact Jacobians compared to the ABRS package relying on finite differences.

## The model

The description (mostly) follows the ABRS paper.

### Households

* There is a unit mass of ex-ante identical households who differ ex-post by their labor productivity $s$ (''skill'') and asset holdings $a$. 


* Skill s follows a time-invariant discrete Markov Chain with $n_s$ states $\mathcal{S}:=\lbrace s_1,s_2,...,s_{n_s}\rbrace$ and exogenous transition probabilities $P(s',s)$. This introduces the income risk. $\pi_s$ denotes the stationary distribution of $P$.


* Savings choices $a$ are the solution to the household's consumption saving problem, which is characterized by the following Bellman equation
```math
V_t(s,a) = \max_{a'} \frac{c^{1-\sigma}-1}{1-\sigma} + \beta \sum_{s'\in \mathcal{S}}P(s',s)V_{t+1}(s',a') 
```
```math
\text{subject to}~~c+a' = (1+r_t)a + w_ts ~~\text{and}~~a'\geq \bar{a}
```

* We denote by $D$ the distribution of households, i.e. $D_t(s,a)$ is the mass of households who start the period with skill $s$ and assets $a$. 

### Firms

* Production is done by a neo-classical firm sector employing a Cobb-Douglas technology of form $Y_t = Z_t K_t^\alpha L_t^{1-\alpha}$, where $Z_t$ is TFP. Capital $K_t$ depreciates by $\delta$ every period. Under the standard assumptions, firms input choices will be characterized by 
```math
r_t + \delta = \alpha Z_t \left(\frac{K_t}{L_t}\right)^{\alpha-1} ~~\text{and}~~w_t = (1-\alpha) Z_t \left(\frac{K_t}{L_t}\right)^{\alpha} 
```



### Market clearing

In an equilibrium, the following market clearing conditions will have to hold:

* Asset market:
```math
K_t = \sum_{s\in \mathcal{S}}\int a D(s,a)da
```

* Labor market
```math
L_t = \sum_{s\in \mathcal{S}}\pi_s(s) s
```

* Good market
```math
Y_t = K_{t+1} - (1-\delta)K_t + \underbrace{\sum_{s\in \mathcal{S}}\int c(s,a) D(s,a)da}_{=\text{aggregate consumption}} 
```

In this model, labor market clearing is trivial as there is no labor supply choice on behalf of hosueholds. Also, if the Asset market clears, the Goods market will also due to Walras' law.


### Calibration:

The calibration follows the example model in the ABRS paper and can be seen in the code block below.
The skill process follows an AR(1)-process in logs that will be discretized to 7 points using the Rouwenhorst method 
(the function implementing the Rouwenhorst method is off-the-shelf from *[QuantEcon.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl)*).

The household discount factor will be calibrated to target a steady state interest real rate of $r_{ss}=0.01$, while $Z_{ss}$ is chosen to normalize $Y_{ss}=1$.

## Implementation

### Numerical Set up

* We will represent the households' policy function as well as the distribution $D(s,a)$ on a grid over $s$ and $a$.


* The discretization of the skill process $s$ is handled by the Rouwenhorst method


* For the asset dimension, we will use an exponentially-spaced grid, which has much more points at the lower end (where the household's policy has more curvature). If $\mathbf{u}(\bar{a},a_{max})$ denotes a uniformly spaced grid between $\bar{a}$ and some $a_{max}$, the exponentially spaced $\mathcal{A}$ grid is given by
```math
\mathcal{A} = a_{min} - 1 + \exp(\mathbf{u}(0.0,\log(1+a_{max}-\bar{a})))
```


* Below is a function generting such a grid.

* For simplicity, I will be using the same grid for both the household (HH) policy functions and distribution


* For accuracy, it may be beneficial to use different ones, e.g. a finer grid for the distribution.


* Additionally, we will set some tolerance value for solving the household problem and include everything in a structure called `NumericalParameters`

## Solving the Household Problem

We are now ready to implement code that solves the household problem in the stationary steady state. We will use the Endogenous Grid Method (EGM) by *[Carroll (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176505003368)*.

For given **next period** marginal value functions/consumption policy functions, it backs out current policy choices by inverting the Euler equation. It is very efficient as it does not use any numerical root finding or optimization.

## Computing the distribution

I will approximate the model's invariant distribution using the non-stochastic simulation method proposed by *[Young (2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188909001316)*.

Practically, we approximate the continous wealth distribution with a discrete one. How?

* We have wealth gridpoints $\mathcal{A}=\lbrace{a_1,a_2,...,a_{na}\rbrace}$ and income grid points $\mathcal{S}$. The unit mass of households needs to be assigned to the points on $\mathcal{A}\times \mathcal{S}$.


* At any gridpoint $(s,a)$, we know the HH savings policy $a'(s,a)$. 


* Now, for savings policy $a'$, find the grid point just below and above so that $a_{i-1}<a'<a_{i}$ 


* Of the mass of agents with (s,a), we assign a share $w_{i-1} := \frac{a'-a_{i}}{a_{i-1}-a_{i}}$ to point $a_{i-1}$ and $(1-w_{i-1})$ to $a_i$. This preserves the total amount saved of these agents as $w_{i-1}a_{i-1}+(1-w_{i-1})a_i=a'$.


* We also need to take into account the income state transitions, so we should thus assign fraction $P(s_1,s)w_{i-1}$ of the mass at $(s,a)$ to $(s_1,a_{i-1})$ and so on.


* This way, treating the discretized distribution as a vector $\mathbf{D}$ of length $n_a \times n_s$, for given savings policies $a'(s,a)$ we can construct a stochastic matrix $\Lambda$ that tells us where the masses assigned to the different grid points will go.


* The steady state distribution will in turn have to fulfill $\mathbf{D} = \Lambda_{ss}'\mathbf{D}$, which is a linear system we can solve for $\mathbf{D}$ (formally, it is the unit eigenvalue of $\Lambda_{ss}'$).


* Below is a function that constructs said transition matrix given policies $a'(s,a)$:

* The consumption function looks as we would expect, steeper close to the borrowing constraint and flatterning out at high wealth levels.


* The wealth distribution looks rather ugly, featuring a huge amount of people at the borrowing constraint and some secondary "spikes" points close to it borrowing constraint (as the big amounts of people at the borrowing constraint being hit by the same income shock all choose to save the same amount)


# Getting the Sequence Space Jacobians

Now we are ready to apply the ABRS method. Explaining in detail how it works would require quite a bit of text, so read the paper for that. I'll just show you the implementation.

First get the object denoted as ``\mathcal{E}`` in their paper:
