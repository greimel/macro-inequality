\subsection*{Description}

The term ``distributional macroeconomics'' was introduced by Benjamin Moll as a replacement for ``macroeconomics with heterogeneous agents'' to promote the view that the \emph{macroeconomy is a distribution} of state variables (e.g.\ income and wealth).\footnote{See \url{ https://benjaminmoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DM_long.pdf}.}

This course will explore some implications of income and wealth heterogeneity for macroeconomic dynamics and macroeconomic policy. First, we want to understand how secular trends (falling interest rates and rising debt) are connected to rising inequality. And second, we want to understand how heterogeneity matters for the aggregate response to macroeconomic shocks.

The focus of the course is on topics, rather than computational methods. (These are covered in second year electives.) We will use simplified models to replicate results from papers and compare the results to empirical evidence. For most topics, we will provide ready-to-run code in the form of interactive \href{https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl}{\texttt{Pluto.jl}} notebooks. 

%The course is based on recent research papers. Most papers build on the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model, some build on the two-agent (Saver-Spender) model.

   Exercise: How does wealth inequality depend on the tax system. (Progressive taxes lower wealth inequality compared to a flat tax.)
