\subsection*{Description}

The term ``distributional macroeconomics'' was introduced by Benjamin Moll as a replacement for ``macroeconomics with heterogeneous agents'' to promote the view that the \emph{macroeconomy is a distribution} of state variables (e.g.\ income and wealth).\footnote{See \url{ https://benjaminmoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DM_long.pdf}.}

This course will explore some implications of income and wealth heterogeneity for macroeconomic dynamics and macroeconomic policy. First, we want to understand how secular trends (falling interest rates and rising debt) are connected to rising inequality. And second, we want to understand how heterogeneity matters for the aggregate response to macroeconomic shocks.

The focus of the course is on topics, rather than computational methods. (These are covered in second year electives.) We will use simplified models to replicate results from papers and compare the results to empirical evidence. For most topics, we will provide ready-to-run code in the form of interactive \href{https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl}{\texttt{Pluto.jl}} notebooks. 

%The course is based on recent research papers. Most papers build on the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model, some build on the two-agent (Saver-Spender) model.

\subsection*{New content}

\begin{enumerate}

\subsection*{Reaction to comments}

\paragraph{General sentiment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Thank you for so many comments in the \emph{open feedback} section
  \item Comments are mostly positive
  \item Critical comments are 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item constructive
    \item not surprising
    \item addressed in future iterations of this course
  \end{itemize}
  \item Recall the first lecture: \emph{This is the worst version of this course.} 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Content}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This is not a course on politicial or sociological aspects of inequality.
  \item The goal is the give a good impression of the current state of research in distributional macroeconomics.
  \item This research is centered around the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model, which is so advanced, that it is usually not taught at the MSc level
  \item Focus on methods (models and computational methods) is unavoidable
  \item Fraction of time spent on applications will increase with the years
  \item Assignment grades: time is scarce
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Teaching Style}

\begin{itemize}
  \item developing material on the iPad is 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item best for clarity
    \item (too) slow
    \item the only way to \emph{develop} a well-structured course
  \end{itemize}
  \item once the structure is set: have some parts pre-written
  \item speed will increase with the years
  \item future: more Julia notebooks/assignments
  \item participation points: ideas to improve system? stickers?
\end{itemize}
