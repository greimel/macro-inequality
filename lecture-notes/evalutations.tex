\begin{frame}{General sentiment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Thank you for so many comments in the \emph{open feedback} section
  \item Comments are mostly positive
  \item Critical comments are 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item constructive
    \item not surprising
    \item addressed in future iterations of this course
  \end{itemize}
  \item Recall the first lecture: \emph{This is the worst version of this course.} 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Content}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This is not a course on politicial or sociological aspects of inequality.
  \item The goal is the give a good impression of the current state of research in distributional macroeconomics.
  \item This research is centered around the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari model, which is so advanced, that it is usually not taught at the MSc level
  \item Focus on methods (models and computational methods) is unavoidable
  \item Fraction of time spent on applications will increase with the years
  \item Assignment grades: time is scarce
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Teaching Style}

\begin{itemize}
  \item developing material on the iPad is 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item best for clarity
    \item (too) slow
    \item the only way to \emph{develop} a well-structured course
  \end{itemize}
  \item once the structure is set: have some parts pre-written
  \item speed will increase with the years
  \item future: more Julia notebooks/assignments
  \item participation points: ideas to improve system? stickers?
\end{itemize}
